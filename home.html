      <p style = "font-size:1.5em"><strong>➤</strong>My interest for Cybersecurity began when I was in Primary 5, where I saw scripts of exploits in a game; Speed, Invincibility and Teleport Hacks. The hackers were also able to hack players' account by phishing them to steal their save.dat.
      <p style = "font-size:1.5em"><strong>➤</strong>I was also a fan of Crimewatch, watching almost every single episode of Crimewatch including those with Cyber Scams; Retrieving Credit Card Information from Old Phones that Scammers purchase online, Ransomware where victims had to pay money in order for them to save their important documents.</p><p style = "font-size:1.5em">This sparked my interest in the Cyber World where I wanted to learn about hacking so that I can become a White Hat Hacker and counteract Cyber Criminals.</p>
